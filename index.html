        <p class="lead mb-4">I have many years of experience in business. I have traveled all over the world for countless reasons all tying back to business. For my understanding of overall business, marketing, and investing. There are also many other skills that I have not mentioned that have contributed to me traveling all over the world. 

One of them being courses. I sell courses to help motivate and instill knowledge upon others about how I made my way up in the business world. This itself is another business journey for me as I can profit off of these courses. I like to lecture people all around the world and help them with all that they need in the business world.

I have the ability to maximize the profits at any business. Due to my deep understanding of business and all that comes with it.
 
When I was nine, my parents decided to foster selective mute identical twins, Rae and Janine. They would not speak at all. They would only answer yes and no questions with their hands. However, they constantly covered their faces with their hands. 24/7, they would not eat, drink, sleep, dress themselves, bathe, or go to the bathroom by themselves. 
When I started third grade, my focus quickly shifted from school to becoming friends with these new people that entered, and began to live, in my house. But I was not only becoming friends with them, but I had to teach them how to function. 
This is what developed my leadership skills. I quickly became much closer to Janinine, I was her primary support, whereas my sister became closer to Rae. Almost everything that I did in my life outside of school she was part of. Towards the beginning of her arrival I did not know what to do in order to help her. As time went on I realized that by simply talking and interacting with her she would develop more social cues. This is what developed my leadership skills.  Because almost everything that I did outside of school was her life too.
Having Janine by my side for a majority of my life required patience. I had to make sure she was okay with everything that I wanted to do, but her opinion was not spoken. It was figured out by meticulously asking yes or no questions and getting a tap back as confirmation or denial. This applied to virtually everything, it even applied to walking, as Janine would not walk if I was not by her side.
This continued for a few years, but as time went on, both Rae and Janine began to function by themselves. By having another person constantly by my side for a good part of my life I developed extreme patience, decision making skills, and additional leadership qualities. Not only did I decipher my own thoughts but I helped to guide Janine through hers as well. 
It is with that being said that I now have great leadership skills in any business.
